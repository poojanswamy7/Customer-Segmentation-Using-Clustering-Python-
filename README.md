# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Python-
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on shopping behavior and demographics. It includes data cleaning, EDA, scaling, cluster analysis, and visualizations like PCA. The goal is to help businesses improve targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.



#DATASET

The dataset used in this project is Shopping_data.csv, which contains customer demographics, purchasing habits, and satisfaction-related information. It includes approximately 3,900 rows and 11 columns.The dataset consists of important attributes such as Customer ID, Shopping Frequency, Age, Gender, Annual Income, Purchase Amount (USD), Review Rating, Membership Status, Payment Method, Satisfaction Score, and Preferred Category.
These features provide valuable insights into a customer’s profile and purchasing behaviour. For segmentation, numerical columns such as Age, Purchase Amount (USD), and Review Rating were particularly useful. After cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates, the data became well structured and ready for clustering.
